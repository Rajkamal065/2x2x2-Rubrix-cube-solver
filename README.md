⚠️ **Note**  
This repository was **mistakenly linked** in my resume as the main project.  
The **actual project** is a Python-based 2x2x2 Rubik’s Cube solver that I built after studying the logic from this C++ version.  
You can find the correct project here:  
👉 [My Python Rubik's Cube Solver](https://github.com/Rajkamal065/2x2x2-Rubrix-cube-solver-1-/tree/main)

### 💡 About the Python Version  
The C++ code here was used as a reference only.  
The Python version is:
- Rewritten from scratch by me
- Uses a different and more optimized algorithm (`IDA*` instead of `BFS`)
- Structured and documented for clarity and efficiency

This update is to maintain transparency and avoid confusion.
